				<h2>Static Website</h2>
				<p>My static website is <a href="https://www.firewatchgame.com">Firewatch</a></p>
				<iframe src="https://www.firewatchgame.com"></iframe>
				<p>This site is static is because I believe that if there is an updates for this games it would be added to the site. There would not be anything to get from a database. Any request would just send the user to another page.</p>

				<h2>Dynamic Website</h2>
				<p>My dynamic website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a></p>
				<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com"></iframe>
				<p>This site is dynamic because with the thousands and thousands of videos posted, it would be too much to host. So all these videos would be put on the database for everyone to access easily. It is even personalized with some of the recommended videos.</p>
