		<h1> In Class Assignment 1</h1>
		<p><strong>What constitutes a creative web project today?</strong><br>
		A creative web project, today, goes beyond the normal and pushes forward to reach new possibilities of the web and the internet. It is done in such a way that it gets and grabs the people who are seeing or interacting with it.<br><br>
		<strong>How do each of you wish to employ the web or the internet as a creative platform?</strong><br>
		The way I want to uses the web as a creative platform is to help people make websites and/or apps so that they can make their own presence online.<br><br>
		<strong>What are your goals in this course?</strong><br>
		My hope for the course is to build on my knowledge of the web, and learn how to use, from what I know already.</p>
